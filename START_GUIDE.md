## Troubleshooting

### Backend not connecting?
Check `lib/api.ts` - make sure `API_BASE_URL` is:
```typescript
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:3001';
```

### Admin panel not showing?
Make sure you're logged into the app first:
1. Go to Auth screen
2. Login or register
3. Then navigate to Admin tab

### Can't see transactions?
Make sure:
- Backend is running on port 3001
- MongoDB is running on localhost:27017
- You've created at least one transaction
